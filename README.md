# Polarity Style Guide Integration

Polarity's Style Guide Integration provides an overview of the built-in CSS classes that integration developers can use while developing their integrations to ensure a consistent look and feel.

> Note that this guide is for Polarity Web 3.x which is currently in beta.

The guide shows examples of the basic classes within the details block of the integration so you can see exactly how various classes will look.
